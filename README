The template builds a VM image from /usr/src (override by setting
FREEBSD_HOST_SRC_PATH).  The intent is to enable iterative kernel
development by making it quick to compile and install a new kernel
into the image.

1. run.sh boots the image with bhyve.  Before this can be used,
   the jail must be configured to allow VM creation:

   # bastille config <jail name> set allow.vmm
   # bastille restart <jail name>

   The jail's devfs rules must permit access to vmm(4) devices.
   To do this, add the following to the devfs ruleset for the jail:

   add path 'vmm' unhide
   add path 'vmm/*' unhide
   add path 'vmm.io' unhide
   add path 'vmm.io/*' unhide

   The ruleset can be configured with:

   # bastille config <jail name> set devfs_ruleset <ruleset number>
   # bastille restart <jail name>

2. build.sh builds a new kernel and installs it into a separate
   disk, rather than rebuilding the whole image.  The VM boots
   from this separate disk.  The VM can be running while this
   script is running; after a reboot it'll boot the new kernel.
